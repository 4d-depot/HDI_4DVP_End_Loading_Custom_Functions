# HDI_4DVP_End_Loading_Custom_Functions

Importing documents is a common task when working with 4D View Pro. However, when these documents contain custom functions, it can be challenging to determine when all calculations are completed before performing actions like printing or saving. To solve this, 4D 20 R9 makes sure that the callback formula of import commands is done only after all custom functions have been fully dealt with. This improvement gives more control and reliability when working with imported View Pro documents.
